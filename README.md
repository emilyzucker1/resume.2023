About Me

Hello!

My name is Emily and I'm currently a computer science student at the University of Florida with experience in Python.

I decided that a clever way to present my resume to my employers is by building a Python program and saving the output as a pdf. 

In this program, I implemented a few concepts I've learned from my programming classes, such as functions, very basic built in methods, classes, inheritance, modules etc. 

You'll notice in the version of the program that I've decided to upload here, certain information is vague, such as "my high school" and "place I volunteered at". This is for safety reasons, as I don't want to make my personal information public where anyone can access it. Similarly, these changes have been made to the pdf file that displays the program output. 

You'll notice in resume.py that I imported a module called "fontstyle". Unfortunately, the pdf version of the output does not support the features added by this module, of which i've used "bold" and "Italic". However, if you run it in your IDE of choice, it should work in the output terminal! 

Thanks for taking the time to stop by and read a bit about me!
