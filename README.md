About Me

Hello!

My name is Emily and I'm currently a computer science student at the University of Florida with experience in Python.

I decided that a clever way to present my resume to my employers is by building a Python program and saving the output as a pdf. 

In this program, I implemented a few concepts I've learned from my programming classes, such as functions, very basic built in methods, classes, inheritance, etc. 

Thanks for taking the time to stop by and read a bit about me!
